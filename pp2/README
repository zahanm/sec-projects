class being eval'd hole
there is no direct benefit to the functionality eval'ing the class seems to provide, so I just stripped it out by removing the eval.

setting arbitrary HTML on the search page hole
set the textContent / innerText property of the nodes rather than innerHTML. Safer.

move logo to public/
It is an easy to access private resource that is not subject to cross-origin restrictions. Safer to leave as a static file (that it is)
FUNCTIONALITY CHANGE: logo is made public
