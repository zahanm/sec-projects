class being eval'd hole
there is no direct benefit to the functionality eval'ing the class seems to provide, so I just stripped it out by removing the eval.
ORIGINAL ATTACKS: (e)

setting arbitrary HTML on the search page hole
set the textContent / innerText property of the nodes rather than innerHTML. Safer.
ORIGINAL ATTACKS: (a) and (e)

move logo to public/
It is an easy to access private resource that is not subject to cross-origin restrictions. Safer to leave as a static file (that it is)
FUNCTIONALITY CHANGE: logo is made public
ORIGINAL ATTACKS: (d)

access logo through randomly generated path that is set at login
so it is accessed through a path like '/secret/ivvzkyjwti.png'
FUNCTIONALITY RESTORED: logo is private again
ORIGINAL ATTACKS: (d)

CSRF protection
when rendering a form, include random 20 character sequence to deter cross site request forgery
used for all POST and PUT calls that change information server side
ORIGINAL ATTACKS: (b) and (c)

SQL Injection
Changed user login to use parameterized SQL from ActiveRecord framework rather than self-implemented sanitization.
ORIGINAL ATTACKS: (c)

rm all Javascript deps
No need for zoobars.js or jQuery
Render the html consitently in server-side HAML templating language
just decreases attack surface area from javascript in general

CHOSE NOT TO IMPLEMENT:

check referrer header
In this forum post https://courseware.stanford.edu/pg/forum/question/301279/no-referer-field we are told that we should support browsers that strip out the referrer field, in which case we decided that our csrf protection \was already strong enough without this additional check that we'd have to waive anyhow
