class being eval'd hole
there is no direct benefit to the functionality eval'ing the class seems to provide, so I just stripped it out by removing the eval.

setting arbitrary HTML on the search page hole
set the textContent / innerText property of the nodes rather than innerHTML. Safer.

move logo to public/
It is an easy to access private resource that is not subject to cross-origin restrictions. Safer to leave as a static file (that it is)
FUNCTIONALITY CHANGE: logo is made public

access logo through randomly generated path that is set at login
so it is accessed through a path like '/secret/ivvzkyjwti.png'
FUNCTIONALITY RESTORED: logo is private again

CSRF protection
when rendering a form, include random 20 character sequence to deter cross site request forgery
used for all POST and PUT calls that change information server side
