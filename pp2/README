class being eval'd hole
there is no direct benefit to the functionality eval'ing the class seems to provide, so I just stripped it out by removing the eval.

setting arbitrary HTML on the search page hole
set the textContent / innerText property of the nodes rather than innerHTML. Safer.

move logo to public/
It is an easy to access private resource that is not subject to cross-origin restrictions. Safer to leave as a static file (that it is)
FUNCTIONALITY CHANGE: logo is made public

access logo through randomly generated path that is set at login
so it is accessed through a path like '/secret/ivvzkyjwti.png'
FUNCTIONALITY RESTORED: logo is private again

CSRF protection
when rendering a form, include random 20 character sequence to deter cross site request forgery
used for all POST and PUT calls that change information server side

SQL Injection
Changed user login to use parameterized SQL from ActiveRecord framework rather than self-implemented sanitization.
