key and size of key used for encryption:
I was unsure of whih key we were expected to provide, so this is the client key, provided during the ClientKeyExchange step of TLS.

login name and password for connecting to ftp server finitestatemachine.stanford.edu (172.24.73.102):
username: harinym
password: harinym

identify active and passive ftp, explain difference:
The server defaults to active mode, and the PORT command specifies a port to connect to for a RETR.
For example
  PORT 192,168,113,129,236,11
where,
Active IP address: 192.168.113.129 (192.168.113.129)
Active port: 60427

In this trace, the second ftp session uses active transfers.
The ftp server (finitestatemachine.stanford.edu) connects to the client (192.168.113.129), on the port specified and then starts the transfer.
The server software seems to think passive mode is preferable though, it warns 'consider using PASV' on using PORT.

The PASV command puts the server into passive mode.
The server respondes with something like
  227 Entering Passive Mode (172,24,73,102,38,15)
where,
Passive IP address: finitestatemachine.stanford.edu (172.24.73.102)
Passive port: 9743

In passive mode, the server will wait for the client to establish a connection with it rather than attempting to connect to a client-specified port.
All the files in the first session are downloaded this way.

What file(s) were downloaded? Give complete download path and their sizes:
First session,
ftp/README : 55 bytes
ftp/pine.tar.gz : 4218629 bytes

Second session,
ftp/thrift.tgz : 682730 bytes
wget-1.12.tar.gz : 2464747 bytes

It appears there are three tracert's from that source address.
I am going to focus on the chronologically first one.
